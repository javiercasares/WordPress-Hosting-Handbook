# About the Hosting Team

## What is the WordPress Hosting Team?

The Hosting team works to improve the WordPress user experience across hosting environments through user collaboration and education.

Although, in principle, it is focused on those people responsible for WordPress in hosting companies, all those system administrators, programmers or interested in the world of web hosting are invited.

## When does the Hosting team meet?

The hosting team meets at [Slack -wordpress- #hosting-community](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community/) on Wednesdays at 09:00 UTC (9 a.m.) and 18:00 UTC (6 p.m.). The conversations are in English. Check out the [WordPress Meeting calendar](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings#hosting) for the current schedule.

## Team Reps

The hosting team is represented by our team reps [@amykamala](https://profiles.wordpress.org/amykamala/), [@mikeschroder](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikeschroder/), and [@jadonn](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jadonn/).

## Get Involved

### What does the hosting team do?

The hosting team works on [several projects](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/team-projects/).

Mainly there is the development of the [Hosting Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/), which is the manual where you can find all the information and is divided into the sections [Performance](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/performance/), [Reliability](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/reliability/), [Security](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/security/) and [Server Environment](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/).

For hosting companies there is the [PHPUnit test runner](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-runner) and [PHPUnit test reporter](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-reporter) tool. These tools provide information about the configurations of the different settings and their compatibility with different and future developments.

#### Improved Hosting Handbook

The idea is to expand and improve the manual that is used as a basis for the equipment and where doubts should be resolved.

You can also include ideas or elements that you think could be useful for your work and the training of WordPress users.

#### Improvements in the development of the PHPUnit test tools


If you are a developer (or if you are a user and want to improve the tool), you might want to propose improvements or solve those available in both the [PHPUnit test runner (issues)](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-runner/issues) and the [PHPUnit test reporter (issues)](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-reporter/issues).

### First steps for New Contributors

You can find the global WordPress Slack at [wordpress.slack.com](https://wordpress.slack.com/). When you are in, find the [#hosting-community](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community/) channel.
